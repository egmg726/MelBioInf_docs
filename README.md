# Melbourne Bionformatics tutorials

Repository for Melbourne Bioinformatics [tutorials website](https://melbournebioinformatics.github.io/MelBioInf_docs/).

## New tutorials
New tutorials (2025 onwards) are being built with [The Carpentries Workbench](https://carpentries.github.io/workbench/). For that, we have a [custom UoM fork](https://github.com/melbournebioinformatics/uom-varnish) of [Varnish](https://carpentries.github.io/varnish/), the package that provides the interface template for The Workbench.

**To create a Markdown-based workshop, use [the Markdown template](https://github.com/melbournebioinformatics/workbench-template-md).**

**To create an RMarkdown-based workshop, use [the RMarkdown template](https://github.com/melbournebioinformatics/workbench-template-rmd).**
RMarkdown workshops allow execution and compilation of code to render the final workshop website.

On the template repository, **click "Use this template"** on the top-right corner.

For more information, please see [our Wiki](https://github.com/melbournebioinformatics/MelBioInf_docs/wiki).
